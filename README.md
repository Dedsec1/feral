# feral
These are just some scripts that I have been working on for my personal use, and for the feralhosting wiki.
This is my first real github repo, so if it doesnt seem like I know what im doing here... that is why.

I'm a novice bash scripter, and I thought this would be a good way to practice, so I'm open to any/all issues, pull requests, suggestions, whatever.

thanks
